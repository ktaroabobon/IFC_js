## Issues

You can refer your issue to the specific repository: 

- [web-ifc](https://github.com/tomvandig/web-ifc) if you have any problem with the parsing / loading (items not being readed / loaded correctly, information missing).

- [web-ifc-three](https://github.com/agviegas/web-ifc-three) if you have any problem with the adaptation we did for Three.js (efficiency, Three geometry generation, etc).

- [web-ifc-viewer](https://github.com/IFCjs/web-ifc-viewer) if you have any problem with the boilerplate code it offers to develop BIM viewers.

- This repository if you have any problem with the specific implementation of an example.
